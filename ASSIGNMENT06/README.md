# Interface Design

### Project Description

This assignment is based off of the wireframe of <b> FamConnect </b>,
and fleshes out a higher fidelity prototype for the interface. We want
to add more detail and refine the design, while our process and iterations.
This will be important in justifying the selected final design with
reasoning. 

So far, we've created wireframes and two flows for two scenarios 
based on our personas. I selected the "greeting" page, which is the
"Login page" of my wireframes.

### Screen Design

The following designs are iterations of the typography, shape,
and colors of the user interface. 

#### Typographic Variations

When designing this aspect of the interface, I looked at different typefaces from
https://fonts.google.com/, as they provided several different options for my app. I also
considered changing the size of the fonts for titles, subtitles, and body text.

#### Shape Variations

For my login wireframe, I had a limited number of elements in which to add a variety of shapes. Specifically, I looked at rounded corners for my "Login" button component, and the input boxes for the username and password.

#### Color Variations

I used different color theme tools to determine different color options, but I found [Khroma](https://khroma.co) to be most effective at finding the best color palette for my theme. I was looking for themes that were friendly and fun, while providing a sense of community. From my sources, I considered 3 different color palettes, and created both light and dark color themes.

#### Layout Test

I set-up a grid system to best lay out the elements of my login page.

### Impression Test

Summary of Findings: Overall, the short impression test went well, as the participant liked the color choices. She said words like "inviting" and "easy to read" which had to do with the color selections. By ensuring that the colors followed the contrast ratio, while considering various
color palletes, we enhance the experience of the application. She also mentioned the fonts, as the fonts that were chosen seem friendly and grounded. 

### Accessibity Test - Color Contrast

Testing for accessibility is an important aspect of interface design. For this assignment, I looked at accessibility in terms of color schemes, which can be done using a contrast checker. 

These tests were conducted  WCAG 2.0, to best determine the accessbility of the colors of the application. I used the Spark Figma plugin to collect scores for each of the color variations.
