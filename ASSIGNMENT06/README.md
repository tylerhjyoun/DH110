# Interface Design

## Tyler Youn

## UCLA DH110 Spring 2023

### Project Description

This assignment is based off of the wireframe of <b> FamConnect </b>,
and fleshes out a higher fidelity prototype for the interface. We want
to add more detail and refine the design, while our process and iterations.
This will be important in justifying the selected final design with
reasoning. 

So far, we've created wireframes and two flows for two scenarios 
based on our personas. I selected the "greeting" page, which is the
"Login page" of my wireframes.
