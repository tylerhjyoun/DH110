# Usability Evaluation for LA County Website
## Tyler Youn
## UCLA DH110 Spring 2023

### Purpose of  Testing
Usability testing is a valuable technique of evaluating a product based on how a user interacts with it. We produced some potential issues based on Nielson's Ten Usability Heuristics in the previous assignment. For instance, I found that the navigation was unclear and there was evidence of inconsistent design. With usability testing, we aim to target these potential issues and test whether they are inconvenient or inefficient to the user experience. By using real-world scenarios that are meant to simulate real usage of the web-app, the test puts the user under the scope such that genuine interactions and reactions can be recorded. Furthermore, this evaluation can help garner user feedback to help address these problems and add improvements, making it a data-driven approach to enhance the website's usability.

### UT Reflection and Conclusion
This was my first time as a moderator of a usability test. In class, I experienced being a participant and being guided through the process, but now it was my turn to ask the questions and gather feedback on my web-app. During the actual test, I found it interesting that my participant did not see the steps as well as I did; this led to conclude that I may have made certain assumptions about the visibilty of icons and menu items. For example, my participant had trouble with the filtering menu, and spend more time than expected trying to find the "Outdoor Activities" box, although I had been able to see it when I first was determining the correct steps. Overall, though, she was able to complete all three of the tasks while explaining her thought process, which I believe went well. It was interesting to see a different perspective of the app usage, and seeing how different people use the app in different ways. In the future, I think I could have made the survey questions less wordy and more simple, as the participant got confused by the wording of some sections and needed to ask me for clarification.
