## Introduction 

This project aims to enhance and improve family bonding by facilitating a platform where families can easily find classes and activities in their communities. By providing a simple registration process as well as a curated selection of courses, this application aims to make it as easy as possible for a family to discover their next weekend activity. The following web document includes user research and competitor analysis, as well as storytelling elements, to justify and aid in building a wireflame and flow. It takes a full and complete approach to present a novel design to respond to the design challenge.  

## Design Statement

The challenge was about family connection, and how we can use digital means to enhance it. To speak on my personal experience, I believe that spending quality time by doing a shared and fun activity is an excellent way to bond with family. However, a common problem that emerges is finding and discovering unique and interesting things to do. It is important to bridge the gap between families and groups who are seeking activities, and the unbooked activities and things that are available for them. 

In this project, I found that users want a convenient and simple way to be able to register for such courses. Moreover, based on user feedback, providing curated recommendations based on interests and availablity can make it easier and more likely for families to choose a course. I believe that by resolving this issue with my project, it will provide families with hours of new and fun experiences. 

## Competitor Analysis 

### Heuristic Evaluation

Using Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, I evaluated two apps based on their ability to accomplish a core task: register for an in-person/virtual course for a group of two or more family members that share a common interest like painting, yoga, or gardening.
