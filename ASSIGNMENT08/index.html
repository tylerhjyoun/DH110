    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p class ="lead">This project aims to enhance and improve family bonding by facilitating a platform where families can easily find 
      classes and activities in their communities. By providing a simple registration process as well as a curated selection of courses, 
      this application aims to make it as easy as possible for a family to discover their next weekend activity. The following web document 
      includes user research and competitor analysis, as well as storytelling elements, to justify and aid in building a wireflame and flow. 
      It takes a full and complete approach to present a novel design to respond to the design challenge.  
    </p>
    <h2> Design Statement </h2>

    <p class="lead"> The challenge was about family connection, and how we can use digital means to enhance it. To speak on my personal
      experience, I believe that spending quality time by doing a shared and fun activity is an excellent way to bond with family.
      However, a common problem that emerges is finding and discovering unique and interesting things to do. It is important to bridge 
      the gap between families and groups who are seeking activities, and the unbooked activities and things that are available for them. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    In this project, I found that users want a convenient and simple way to be able to register for such courses. 
      Moreover, based on user feedback, providing curated recommendations based on interests and availablity can make it easier
      and more likely for families to choose a course. I believe that by resolving this issue with my project, it will provide
      families with hours of new and fun experiences. </p>

    <h2> Competitor Analysis </h2>

    <h3> Heuristic Evaluation </h3>

    <p class="lead"> Using Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, I evaluated two apps based on their ability
      to accomplish a core task: register for an in-person/virtual course for a group of two or more family members that share
      a common interest like painting, yoga, or gardening.

      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="lead"> 
    For both applications, the aesthetic and minimalist design was a significant issue, 
      as it made it difficult for the user to know how to navigate the site. Moreover, the 
      lack of spacing and walls of text made it overwhelming for the user, as it overloads them with 
      information. This heuristic was scored a severity score of 3, as the aesthetics and minialism
      should aid in making the design more intuitive and simple for the user. 
    I also found that the LA County Parks&Rec application could be more consistent, in showing the 
      availability for a class, as they still showed all classes regardless of availability. This means
      that the user will jump from class to class even if they are not available for registration. 
      In the same vein, in the Wondrium app, the app was not too flexible and efficient to use, as 
      there was no filter in the home or the search page. The users were just given a large catalogue
      of classes and told to choose.
