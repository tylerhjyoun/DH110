    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p class ="lead"> 
      Imagine a platform where families can discover fun and dynamic activities and register 
      for them effortlessly. Where selections of classes, courses, and events are curated and presented to
      users based on preferences and interests. 
            
      This application aims to make it as easy as possible for a family to discover their next weekend activity
      in their communities. 
      
      The following web document 
      includes user research and competitor analysis, as well as storytelling elements, to justify and aid
      in building a wireflame and flow. It takes a full and complete approach to present a novel design to respond to the design challenge.  
    </p>
        
    <h2> Design Statement </h2>

    <p class="lead"> I believe that spending quality time by doing a shared and fun activity is an excellent way to bond with family.
      However, a common problem that emerges is finding and discovering unique and interesting things to do. It is important to bridge 
      the gap between families and groups who are seeking activities, and the unbooked activities and things that are available for them. 
    </p>
     
    <p class="lead">
    In this project, I found that users want a convenient and simple way to be able to register for such courses. 
      Moreover, based on user feedback, providing curated recommendations based on interests and availablity can make it easier
      and more likely for families to choose a course. I believe that by resolving this issue with my project, it will provide
      families with hours of new and fun experiences. </p>

    <h2> Competitor Analysis </h2>


    <p class="lead"> Using Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, I evaluated two apps based on their ability
      to accomplish a core task: register for an in-person/virtual course for a group of two or more family members that share
      a common interest like painting, yoga, or gardening.

             <h3> Heuristic Evaluation </h3>
         
                <p> 
                  The heuristics revealed some glaring issues for both applications. The LA County app 
                  was crowded and filled with walls of text, failing the aesthetic and minimalist
                  design heauristic. The layout of the information, as well as the
                  inconsistency, as they still showed all classes regardless of availability, causes the user
                  to jump from class page to class page even if they are not available for registration. 
                  In the same vein, in the Wondrium app, the app was not too flexible and efficient to use, as 
                   there was no filter in the home or the search page. The users were just given a large catalogue
                     of classes and told to choose.           
          </p>

                 <p>
          From these evaluations, I realized that making the design and layout as simple and clear as possible 
                   was important. The user should be able to know the system status, as well as where they 
                   are in the process. Finally, I learned that when presenting a catalogue of courses or information,
                   it is important to try to present the most important or relevant listings for the user.

              <h3> Usability Testing </h3>
              
              <p>
                I also performed an usability evaluation of the LA County Parks & Recreation web application,
                in order to reveal issues based on how a user interacts with it. I led a user to find
                family-friendly activites, filter by schedule, and share course information in 
                real time. From the questionnaire and follow-up questions, I learned that having an
                intuitive filter feature was important to guiding the desired courses to the user.

    <h2> User Research </h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="lead">
              In the previous analysis, we looked at an existing web-application, to evaluate a product based on
             a user's interactions with it. In this contextual inquiry, we dive deeper into the core tasks 
             and original problems that the LA County Parks & Recreation app was designed to address.

      <div class="row">

             The focused task that was assigned to the user was:
               <div class="lead mb-4 mt-4 alert alert-info">
               Could you show me how you would search for in-person classes or activities 
               to do with your family?
               </div>
             
               After the interview, I realized that I had not considered having access to the instructor's 
             portfolio, or reviews of the course. These elements are large deciding factors for people 
             who may be interested in registering. Also, the course description page of the analyzed website 
             provided a vague description, which was not insightful nor did it paint a full picture of 
             what the class is about.

    <h2> UX Storytelling </h2>

    <p class="lead">
      To step into the shoes of the target users, we develop personas to understand their motivations, goals, feelings, emotions, and background. 
      Ultimately, we adopt these personas to gain insights from the user's perspective. 
                </p>
                <h3> Personas + Scenarios </h3>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="../ASSIGNMENT04/s1.png" />
              <p class="text-center"> Persona 2 </p>

        
        </div>
        <div class="col-8">
          I propose two features for my application that the developed personas will interact with and utilize. 
          
          <div class="lead mb-4 mt-4 alert alert-info">
           The first feature is having a simple family profile setup, and setting up the preferences
          and interests of everyone in the family</div>
          
           <div class="lead mb-4 mt-4 alert alert-info">
            The second feature is finding a class that the user is interested in, and then registering 
            multiple people in the family. </div>
         
          <p>
          For Pam, the first feature is crucial, as she struggles to find an activity with other apps that
          could cater to both her children and her parents. With <b> FamConnect </b> she is able to 
          easily create a family profile within minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
          Sean was also searching for activities for his family, but wanted to avoid generic options like 
          movie and board game nights. The first feature was immensely useful, as it took minimal coordination
          to find a selection of courses that his family can take. The second feature was also useful,
          as he did not have to set up multiple profiles for each member of his family, but rather he 
            could just add them to the registration and checkout together.

                  to the rest in our higher fidelity prototype. 
                  I looked at three specific graphic design elements:
                  
                      <div class="lead mb-4 mt-4 alert alert-info"> Typeface: By considering different
                      fonts and shapes, I was able to select the appropriate font to convey a lighthearted
                      and fun tone. I also sized my fonts according to a hierarchy, to enforce a logical 
                      ordering on the page. </div>
                      
                      <div class="lead mb-4 mt-4 alert alert-info"> Color Scheme: Selecting the right palette is 
                      important, and I chose one that closely related to community and nature, tying 
                      into the original app I analyzed, the LA County Parks and Recreation app. </div>
                      
                      <div class="lead mb-4 mt-4 alert alert-info"> Layout Grid + Spacing: The way that the 
                      page is split is important for differentiating information. If the
                      gutters or margins are small, then the page could feel cramped. 
                      </div>

               
                  For each of my design decisions, I justified according to
                design principles. For example, I used the WCAG standard to ensure that my selected
                colors would provide good contrast. </p>
