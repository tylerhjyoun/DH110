# UX Storytelling - Personas + Scenarios

### Purpose of UX Storytelling


### Proposed Features

1. Based on my usability heuristic research on the LA County Parks and Recreation web application, I found that the initial process of creating an account and signing up was lacking in that the design was not minimalistic and simple, and it was difficult to navigate for the users. They presented large walls of texts and lacked personalization, as they did not ask what interests or topics that the user had. Thus, one feature that my design solution will have is having <b> a simple family profile setup and setting the preferences and interests of everyone in the family. </b>
 
2. During my usability evaluation for the same application, my participant had some trouble when it came to finding a class that she was interested in taking by herself, let alone her entire family. The filtering box was laid out in a confusing order, making it tedious for the user to navigate with. So, the other feature that my design solution will have is <b> finding a class that you are interested in and booking it for multiple people in your family who may be interested. </b>
