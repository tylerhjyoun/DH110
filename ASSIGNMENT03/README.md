# Contextual Inquiry
## Tyler Youn
## UCLA DH110 Spring 2023

In the previous assignment we looked at an existing web-application, the LA County Parks and Recreation site, and ran some usability testing to evaluate how a product is based on how a user interacts with it. In this assignment, we are distancing ourselves from the web application that we designed, instead looking to refine the original problems that this app was designed to address. We do this in the following manner. 

### (1) Specifying the Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity that my project is supporting for the users is being able to find an activity that they can do with their family. In theme with our class's topic for the quarter of family connection, we want to help users of three different generations (teenager, middle-aged, senior) connect by taking an interesting class or learning about some topic together. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for this activity is the need for an engaging and open medium for family members to connect more with each other. The basic goal involved for this activity is finding something that is interesting to all parties involved and doing it as a unit. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solutions are to do so a search on the internet for free and interesting courses that people can do together. They can look for virtual courses, or potentially find a course listing at the local community center. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
Although finding virtual courses online is free and feasible, it is not as interactive and engaging for the audience. When it comes to looking for courses at their local community center, it can be improved by making the listing more accessible for people.

### (2) Identifying the Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 

#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

### (3) Selecting a qualitative Research Method
#### by covert / overt observation
#### by active / passive / participatory interaction
