# Contextual Inquiry
## Tyler Youn
## UCLA DH110 Spring 2023

In the previous assignment we looked at an existing web-application, the LA County Parks and Recreation site, and ran some usability testing to evaluate how a product is based on how a user interacts with it. In this assignment, we are distancing ourselves from the web application that we designed, instead looking to refine the original problems that this app was designed to address. We do this in the following manner. 

### (1) Specifying the Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity that my project is supporting for the users is being able to find an activity that they can do with their family that promotes family connection and bonding. Specically, searching and registering for recreational courses and activities at the local community center. In theme with our class's topic for the quarter of family connection, we want to help users of three different generations (teenager, middle-aged, senior) connect by taking an interesting class or learning about some topic together. 

#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
The basic need involved for this activity is to provide an engaging and open medium for family members to connect more with each other. The basic goal involved for this activity is finding something that is interesting to all parties involved and doing it as a unit. 

#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solutions are search websites for local activities and events, visiting local community centers for course lisings, and browsing bulletin boards and newspapers for events. 

#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The limitations of these current solutions is that they may not have a diverse range of activities that can cater to the needs or are well suited for the different generations. It is  challenging to find an activity that would be engaging, interesting, and affordable across the generations as well. Thus, a more personlized platform with filtering on a wide range ofinterests and age groups can help improve these issues. 

### (2) Identifying the Target Users

#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
Demographics: As stated above, we are targeting families, specifically spanning three different generations of teenager, middle-aged, and senior. 

Preference: The users would prefer activities that cater to their own interests. The activity needs to be engaging and educational as well. Depending on the interests of the family as a collective, they may prefer outdoor experiences or cultural activities. 

Expertise: Since many course offerings and events are beginner friendly, there are activities suitable for all members of the family. If a member has previous expertise already in the subject though, it may not be as engaging for them.

Mainstream vs. Extreme: These activities can be categorized as mainstream, as they are accessible to a wide audience. The courses are beginer-level and not meant to have a high barrier of entry. The focus is rather on making the overall experience engaging and interesting such that the family can bond. 

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Where: The users would do this activity from their phones or any device that can access the internet and the websites. It would involve in-person activities at the local community center or any other designated area.

Why: The users would do this activity of searching for classes in order to find the most well-suited class for their entire family so that they can have an educational bonding experience together. 

Under Which Conditions: To accomodate for schedules for all three generations, this activity would most likely be for the weekends or during holidays, when they have the most free time to take a course.

#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
1. Searching for activities on the internet by looking at various websites. Choose the most accessible community center or location.
2. Filter activites based on the preferences and interests of all family members. Choose an activity that works for all parties.
3. Register for the course on line and pay any fees and sign forms.
4. Sharing the activity or schedule with other family members through email or social media.

### (3) Selecting a qualitative Research Method
#### By Overt Observation
In the context of this activity, we will use overt observation and engage with the participants directly to know their thought process and ask questions as well. We want the participants to behave naturally and communicate transparently with them. 
#### By Passive Interaction 
The researcher will not interact with the participants in their natural environment. This is chosen so that there will be no bias or external influences on their behavior and the observation can remain unbiased.

### Reflection from Field Study
#### Insights from the Data
The data that I collected during this session was important in catching things that I otherwise may not have noticed. By going back to the fundamental problem that the webapp was trying to solve, I conducted this contextual inquiry to better understand how this core activity would occur without the webapp that I had researched in the previous assignment. I had not considered things such as having a feature that allows the user to access the instructor's portfolio or reviews, even though those elements are really important factors when it comes to choosing a class. By making the reviews for both the class and the instructor accessible, we provide a more full picture of what the class is going to entail. My participant did not like how the course description for the classes on the website were vague and did not comprehensively list what the course would include, which is important especially if one class costs over $100! 

#### Lessons Learned
In conducting this interview, I learned that it is essential to establish a comfortable rapport with the participant, either by trying to make conversation or encouraging them to freely talk and discuss about their experiences. I also learned that asking more open-ended questions produced fruitful answers, rather than simple yes or no questions. In the next contextual interview, I would try to be more flexible and adaptable, maybe by preparing a backup plan in the event that we go in a different direction. Furthermore, it was an interesting experience conducting an overt and passive observation method, as even though I noticed the participant veering off slightly from the focus of the task at times, I was able to understand and see why they did so since they were performing it as they would normally.
