# Interactive Prototype

## Tyler Youn

## UCLA DH110 Spring 2023

### Project Description

The purpose of this assignment is to further develop the work and lower fidelity prototypes to visualize how the information and interactions will work on the application. In this part of the project, we want to try to focus on the factors that influence the overall user interaction with the system, and polish the design as well. 

In this process, we'll introduce two interactive tasks that can be accomplished with an interactive prototype. Using all of the design choices from the previous assignments, we can begin to hone down the prototype to work towards a final version of the design. Then, we'll show how those tasks will be accomplished using a wireflow. Finally, the interactive prototype will allow for a demonstration of the flow.
